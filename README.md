# Setlist
## Description:
This project generates a band performance sit list based on the a series of rules and a list of tunes. It was created using Node.JS, Express, and EJS. This is an older project that I had to migrate over from my old IDE, and there might be dependency issues with the packages. 

## Original Problem
I used to create set lists for my community jazz band performances and rehearsals. We had a book consisting of hundreds of different jazz band tunes (sheet music) that we kept in number order with an excel spreadsheet to keep track of it all. If you are not aware of how to make a set list, the tunes in the list must be variable by genre, so there cannot be any repeating genres back to back like swing or rock music. There also must be variety becasue our audience of the ballroom dancing elderly does not want to do the same style of dance in a row. I decided to automate this process with Node.JS.

## Lessons Learned
-I think I can write this in python and do it better now (I first created this in 2019 I believe)
-Check back here later for more!
